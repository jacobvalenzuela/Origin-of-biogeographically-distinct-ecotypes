# Origin-of-biogeographically-distinct-ecotypes
Our systems analyses show how mutations in just 15 D. vulgaris and 7 M. methanococcus genes within a minimal assemblage of an evolved community gave rise to co-existing ecotypes that were spatially enriched within a few days of culturing in a fluidized bed reactor. 


# Abstract:
Resource partitioning is central to the incredible productivity of microbial communities, including gigatons in annual methane emissions through syntrophic interactions. Previous work revealed how a sulfate reducer (Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Dv) and a methanogen (Methanococcus maripaludis, Mm) underwent evolutionary diversification in a planktonic context, improving stability, cooperativity, and productivity within 300-1,000 generations. Here, we show that mutations in just 15 Dv and 7 Mm genes within a minimal assemblage of this evolved community gave rise to co-existing ecotypes that were spatially enriched within a few days of culturing in a fluidized bed reactor. The spatially segregated communities partitioned resources in the simulated subsurface environment, with greater lactate utilization by attached Dv but partial utilization of resulting H2 by low affinity hydrogenases of Mm in the same phase. The unutilized H2 was scavenged by high affinity hydrogenases of planktonic Mm, producing copious amounts of methane. Our findings show how few mutations drive resource partitioning amongst niche-differentiated ecotypes, whose interplay synergistically improves productivity of the entire mutualistic community.
