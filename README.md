# Origin-of-biogeographically-distinct-ecotypes
Our systems analyses show how mutations in just 15 D. vulgaris and 7 M. methanococcus genes within a minimal assemblage of an evolved community gave rise to co-existing ecotypes that were spatially enriched within a few days of culturing in a fluidized bed reactor.
